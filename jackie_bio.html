                        <p>My name is Pharoh Kaidan Swain a future Year-up graduate, scholar and pokemon master. The beginning of my tech field interest began after i graduated with my Associates in web graphic design and technology from Devry University in 2012. Afterwards, my focus was finding a way to generate an income so I delve into the hospitality industry. I graduated from the silver fork (a 6 month intensive hospitality training program)  in late August 2013 with a focus in back of the house prep work. My goal was to gain experience and become a su chef in a year's time.

                       <p>After a period of chef work I moved into a position in the front end of the restaurant; Iâ€™ve remained  in the the front end for the last 3 years. Not forgetting my DeVry training I would occasionally fix my restaurants computers and do little connection jobs. I was still working full-time as host when I heard of Year-Up and decided to invest into my future. Committing to Year-Up has been a journey to say the least; however, it's been a rewarding journey. Hobbies outside of work are pokemon (i play professionally), videogames in general and going to Chicago plays

                        Hello, I am Jacquelynn Keith, I currently train at Year Up Chicago, a rigorous tech based program for youth ages 18-24. I am studying with an emphasis on Software applications, and looking for a position in an environment that offers a greater challenge, high employee engagement, and the opportunity to help the company advance efficiently and productively. While attending Year Up I have improved on my networking, interpersonal, and technical skills with courses in Hardware, software, and Career Development of interpersonal Relations. After the completion of my program I plan on going back to work full time with a career that integrates my background in healthcare with my skill set in IT. While doing that, I will be returning to college to receive my bachelors in health information management within the next two years.
                        Outside of Year Up I currently volunteer at The University of Chicago as a research assistant. This decision is personal because I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things. This opportunity allows me the insight to a typical day at one of the best hospitals in the nation, and an opportunity to help improve the healthcare administered to Americans every day.
                        In my spare time I enjoy traveling around the US, and I have hopes of leaving the country within the next year for a vacation. Beauty vlogging and blogging are also some of my favorite past times, I really enjoy watching hair, makeup, health and wellness videos. Exploring new ways to learn and have fun is something I do monthly, I try different restaurants, museums and attractions whenever I get the chance. My family and friends are very important to me so I like to do a lot of outings and spending quality with them. Own my own and for a peace of mind I take longs walks on the lake front when the weather permits, and I do a lot of meditation which really centers me, and I enjoy writing in my journal.
